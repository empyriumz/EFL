# Entanglement Feature Learning
This repo is forked from https://github.com/EverettYou/EFL as a testbed for the application of EFL in interacting 1D systems.

This project provides an implementation of entanglement feature learning based on a convolutional deep belief network.

## Requirements
* Numpy
* TensorFlow
